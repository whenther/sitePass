sitePass
=========
sitePass is a sort of password manager. You give it the url of a site (say, google.com) and a password (say, password). It combines them using a one-way SHA-256 hash, then uses the encrypted output of that to generate a secure, unique password. Give it a different site (or a different iteration number, if you need to reset a password periodically) and the same base password, and you get an entirely different secure password. This allows you to remember only one password, but give unique and hard-to-break ones to all of your sites. It only uses Javascript on your machine, so your base password never leaves your computer, keeping you safe and secure!
